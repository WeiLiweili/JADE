JADE
====

an on-the-fly surface hopping code for nonadiabatic molecular dynamics of poly-atomic systems

This JADE code has been interfaced with Gaussian, Gamess, Turbomole.
the popular TDDFT/TDA has been interfaced, TDHF/CIS is also possible.
ADC(2)/CC2 is also interfaced with Turbomole.

The Langevin Dynamics is implemented now.


Some of the code is still in progress, which would be updated later, if possible, such as addtional interface to Molpro, Q-CHEM et al., spin orbital coupling, ONIOM/QM/MM feature, force field based dynamics.



This code is mainly developed by Prof. Dr. Zhenggang Lan and co-workers at QIBEBT, Qingdao, China, in recent years.
